# AblePolecat-Stub
This project comprises all the essential files necessary to set up a project 
using the Able Polecat core class library and project installation tool with 
conventional Able Polecat project configuration practices.

In some cases, conventional Able Polecat project configuration practices will not 
meet the requirements of a project. For example, a developer may wish to share 
the Able Polecat class library across multiple projects or maintain project 
files in different file system locations than those expected by a conventional 
project. This project provides developers with instructions on how to override 
Able Polecat project configuration files in support of unconventional projects, 
as well.
